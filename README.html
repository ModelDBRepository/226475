NM_Cortex_SR

This repository contains the reference implementation of the model
proposed in Schellenberger Costa et al. 2016, available
here <a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10827-016-0602-z">http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10827-016-0602-z</a>

This repository is also available here where they may be a newer

For convenience we utilize MATLAB for data processing and
plotting. Therefore the simulation comes with an additional
source-file Cortex_SR_mex.cpp that can be compiled within MATLAB to
utilize their C++-mex interface. The easiest way to reproduce the
figures in the paper is to simply run the Create_Data() function
within MATLAB, assuming the mex interface is setup. Afterwards simply
run the Create_Figures() function to generate the different figures.

Please note that due to the stochastic nature of the simulation the
time series will differ.
